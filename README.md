Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For the Prmled2 project, the goal was to run code that blinked the LEDs at varying brightness levels.
In the GPIO project, the goal was to utilize a state machine two switch among a low, ideal, or high temperature.
Using the temperature sensor, the code sets the device to turn the red LED on if the temperature is below the ideal.
However, if the temperature is at or above the ideal, then the light turns off. This is to signify a heater.
There is also an ability to change the "set-point" (ideal) temperature using the buttons on the side.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did well setting up my state machine. I also succeeded in getting the lights to blink.
I also believe that I did well with the structure of my code. I like to keep it organized.

Where could you improve?

I, unfortunately, could not get the GPIO project to run correctly. This is where I could definitely improve.
I worked on it quite a bit, but there were certain errors that I could not figure out how to fix.
I also failed to trigger the light to turn on or off based on temperature,
even though I feel as I coded my state machine correctly.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I have saved all of the lessons from the Zybooks courses. I believe this will help tremendously in the future.
I also will keep all of the projects and the device to continue to tinker with.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

In this project, I did very well with my time management. I work full-time along with school, so I am quite busy.
I set myself a nice schedule to work on this project as well as I could. 
I also learned to be patient, and test often! 
Many times the errors I ran into were simple fixes.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Again, I, unfortunately, did not complete this project. However I will say it is very readable and adaptable.
Firstly, I believe I organized my code very well. I also made sure to reference what I needed to reference when building my code.
The state machine I code is very adaptable. I am not sure if it is the best way to build a state machine, but I think it is fairly nice.
Other parts of my code could be re-used in other projects as well.
